### 2021 Fall CIS 110 Final Project

This project was made as part of University of Pennsylvania CIS 110 Introduction to Computer Programming program. This is a clone coding of a well-known game "Brick Breaker" using PennDraw Library. 

You can control the x acceleration of the ball by how you move the platform. If you move in the direction of the ball, the ball will accelerate in that
direction. If you move the platform opposite to the vx of the ball, the ball will deaccelerate or even change direction.
